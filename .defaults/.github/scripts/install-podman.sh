# Install a pinned podman static bundle from mgoltzsche/podman-static.
#
# Runner images ship a static podman 5.8.4 bundle under /usr/local/, which
# wins on PATH over anything apt installs at /usr/bin/ -- apt pinning to
# 4.x (#5738) never actually took effect, so podman --version kept
# reporting 5.8.4 regardless. This script installs the *same* version the
# image already ships, explicitly and verifiably, instead of fighting it:
# pinning our own copy over the same /usr/local location guarantees a
# known-good version+checksum regardless of what a future runner image
# update silently changes underneath us. No version change from what's
# already running in the image; smoke-tested end to end via
# functional-tests (real sandbox creation through the OpenShell
# gateway/API socket, not just the diagnostic `podman ps`/`logs` calls
# in internal/sandbox).
#
# This approach mirrors how runner-images itself installs podman
# (self-contained static tarball bundling podman + crun/runc + conmon +
# netavark + aardvark-dns + pasta) and is portable across distros.
#
# See #5733, #5742.
