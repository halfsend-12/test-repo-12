# Copy environment variables whose names start with AGENT_PREFIX into GITHUB_ENV,
# using the name with the prefix stripped (multiline-safe). AGENT_PREFIX must end
# with '_' (e.g. TRIAGE_). The workflow step should set AGENT_PREFIX and any
# AGENT_PREFIX* variables (e.g. secrets mapped under prefixed names).
#
# Per-run override passthrough: when FULLSEND_REPO_VARS holds the caller
# repository's Actions variables as JSON (`${{ toJSON(vars) }}`), the
# allowlisted FULLSEND_* override variables are exported too, so a repo can
# switch a role's runtime/model/effort with a repository variable instead of
# a pull request. A role-prefixed variable (TRIAGE_FULLSEND_MODEL) wins over
# the plain one (FULLSEND_MODEL). Values must be single-line and limited to
# the characters a model id / runtime name can contain; anything else is
# skipped with a warning. fullsend validates the values themselves.
# The whole variable map is passed (not individual keys) because the
# custom-harness matrix job only knows its role at runtime and GitHub
# expressions cannot upper-case it to build the prefixed name; the map holds
# the caller repository's own non-secret Actions variables, which the
# workflow can already read, and only the allowlisted keys leave this script.
